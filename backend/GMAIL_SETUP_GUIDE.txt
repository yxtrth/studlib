üìß GMAIL APP PASSWORD SETUP GUIDE
========================================

The current error "Username and Password not accepted" means your Gmail App Password needs to be updated.

üîß STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Find "2-Step Verification" and turn it ON
   - This is REQUIRED for App Passwords

2. **Generate App Password**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" from dropdown
   - Select "Windows Computer" (or your device)
   - Click "Generate"
   - Copy the 16-character password (like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop)

3. **Update .env File**
   - Replace EMAIL_PASS=axlabnhsywntejz
   - With your new App Password (remove spaces)
   - EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop

4. **Test Again**
   - Restart your backend server
   - Run: node test-otp-flow.js

‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Use App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password
- App Password is 16 characters without spaces
- Must have 2FA enabled first
- Each app needs its own App Password

üìß Current Config:
EMAIL_USER=libyatharth@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=axlabnhsywntejz (‚Üê This needs to be updated!)

üß™ After updating, test with:
cd "c:\Users\KANTIKA TIWARI\Desktop\student lib\backend"
node test-otp-flow.js
