# üîß MongoDB Authentication Error Fix

## ‚ùå Problem:
```
MongoServerError: bad auth : authentication failed
code: 8000, codeName: 'AtlasError'
```

## üéØ Solution Steps:

### 1. Check MongoDB Atlas Database User:
1. Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Database Access" (left sidebar)
4. Find your database user
5. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure:
   - Username is correct
   - Password is correct
   - User has "Read and write to any database" permissions

### 2. Update Render Environment Variables:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your "student-library-backend" service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Check/Update these variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@cluster0.mongodb.net/student-library?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**CRITICAL**: Make sure:
- Username matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Password has NO special characters that need URL encoding
- Database name is correct ("student-library")

### 3. Common MongoDB Atlas Issues:

#### A. Password with Special Characters:
If your password has special characters, URL encode them:
- `@` becomes `%40`
- `#` becomes `%23`
- `&` becomes `%26`
- `?` becomes `%3F`

#### B. Wrong Database Name:
Make sure the database name in the URI matches your actual database.

#### C. IP Whitelist:
1. In MongoDB Atlas, go to "Network Access"
2. Make sure "0.0.0.0/0" is whitelisted (allows all IPs)
3. Or add Render's IP ranges

### 4. Create New Database User (If Needed):
1. In MongoDB Atlas ‚Üí "Database Access"
2. Click "Add New Database User"
3. Choose "Password" authentication
4. Username: `studlib-user`
5. Password: Generate a simple password (no special chars)
6. Role: "Read and write to any database"
7. Click "Add User"

### 5. Test Connection:
Use this connection string format:
```
mongodb+srv://studlib-user:simple-password@cluster0.mongodb.net/student-library?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### 6. Update Render:
1. Copy the new MONGODB_URI
2. Update in Render environment variables
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Redeploy the service

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:
1. **Check your MongoDB Atlas credentials**
2. **Update MONGODB_URI in Render**
3. **Redeploy backend service**

## ‚úÖ After Fix:
Your signup functionality should work properly in production.
