🔍 REGISTRATION 400 ERROR - QUICK FIX GUIDE
===========================================

## 🎯 THE ISSUE:
You're getting a 400 error from the backend, which means:
- The registration request is REJECTED by the server
- Missing or invalid required fields
- No successful registration = No OTP page redirect

## 🧪 STEP-BY-STEP DEBUG:

### 1. Open Network Tab Details
When you see the 400 error in Network tab:
1. Click on the failed POST request to /api/auth/register
2. Click "Response" tab to see the error message
3. Look for something like:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "message": "Name, email, and password are required"
   }
   ```

### 2. Check Request Data
In the same Network request:
1. Click "Request" tab 
2. Look at the "Form Data" or "Request Payload"
3. Verify all fields are being sent:
   - name
   - email  
   - password
   - studentId
   - department

### 3. Common Causes of 400 Error:

❌ **Missing Required Fields**
- One of: name, email, password not filled
- Empty or whitespace-only values

❌ **Password Too Short**  
- Backend requires password ≥ 6 characters
- Check password field has valid value

❌ **Email Format Issue**
- Invalid email format
- Email field is empty

❌ **FormData vs JSON Issue**
- Frontend sends FormData
- Backend expects different format

## 🚀 QUICK TEST - Try This:

### Fill Form Exactly Like This:
```
Name: John Doe
Email: johndoe@example.com  
Password: testpass123
Student ID: STU001
Department: Computer Science
Bio: Test registration
```

### What to Watch:
1. Fill ALL fields (don't leave any empty)
2. Use a REAL email format
3. Password must be 6+ characters
4. Watch Network tab for the actual error message

## 🔧 LIKELY FIXES:

### Fix A: Missing confirmPassword
The backend might expect confirmPassword field:
- Check if registration form has "Confirm Password" field
- If missing, it could cause 400 error

### Fix B: Required Fields Validation
Backend expects these exact fields:
- name (required)
- email (required) 
- password (required, 6+ chars)

### Fix C: FormData Format
The form sends FormData but backend might expect JSON:
- This is a frontend/backend mismatch
- Need to check backend multer configuration

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS:

1. **Check the 400 error response message** - this will tell us exactly what's wrong
2. **Verify all form fields are filled** - especially required ones
3. **Try with different data** - use simple test values
4. **Report the exact error message** - so I can fix the specific issue

The 400 error response will contain the exact reason for rejection. 
Once we see that message, I can fix the issue immediately! 🔍
