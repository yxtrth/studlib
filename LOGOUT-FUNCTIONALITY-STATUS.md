# 🚪 Logout Functionality - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED ✅

## 📋 Summary:
Your Student Library application **already has complete logout functionality** implemented! No additional code is needed.

## 🎯 What's Already Working:

### 1. **Frontend Implementation:**
- ✅ **Redux Store** (`authSlice.js`):
  - `logout` async thunk that clears tokens and calls backend
  - State management for authentication status
  - Automatic cleanup of localStorage and axios headers

- ✅ **Navbar Component** (`Navbar.js`):
  - Desktop: Profile dropdown with "Sign out" button
  - Mobile: Hamburger menu with "Sign out" button
  - `handleLogout()` function with toast notifications
  - Automatic redirect to home page after logout

### 2. **Backend Implementation:**
- ✅ **Auth Routes** (`auth.js`):
  - `POST /api/auth/logout` endpoint
  - Returns success response for client-side token cleanup

### 3. **User Experience:**
- ✅ **Profile Dropdown**: Click avatar → "Sign out"
- ✅ **Mobile Menu**: Hamburger menu → User section → "Sign out"  
- ✅ **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback
- ✅ **Navigation**: Redirects to home page after logout
- ✅ **State Cleanup**: Removes token from localStorage
- ✅ **Authorization**: Clears axios authorization headers

## 🔄 How Logout Works:

1. **User clicks "Sign out"** in profile dropdown or mobile menu
2. **`handleLogout()` function** is triggered
3. **Redux `logout` action** is dispatched
4. **Token removed** from localStorage
5. **Axios headers cleared** (removes Authorization header)
6. **Backend endpoint called** (`/api/auth/logout`)
7. **User state reset** (user = null, isAuthenticated = false)
8. **Success toast shown** to user
9. **Navigation redirect** to home page (/)

## 🧪 How to Test:

1. **Open your React app**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Login** with any valid credentials
3. **Click on your profile avatar** (top-right corner)
4. **Click "Sign out"** from dropdown
5. **Verify**:
   - Redirected to home page
   - No longer authenticated
   - Can't access protected routes
   - Success toast appears

## 📱 Available Logout Locations:

### Desktop:
