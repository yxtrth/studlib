⏳ Testing backend response...

## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED:

### 1. Backend Deployment Fix:
- Updated root package.json with proper start script
- Added all required dependencies
- Fixed Render deployment configuration

### 2. GitHub Actions Fix:
- Fixed YAML syntax errors
- Added proper event triggers
- 24/7 keep-alive automation restored

## 🧪 TEST YOUR REGISTRATION NOW:

### Step 1: Open Your App
```
https://inquisitive-kashata-b3ac7e.netlify.app/register
```

### Step 2: Fill Registration Form
- Name: Test User
- Email: (use your real email)
- Password: testpassword123
- Student ID: TEST123
- Department: Computer Science

### Step 3: Monitor During Registration
1. Press F12 to open developer tools
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Click "Create Account" button
4. Watch for POST request to /api/auth/register

### Step 4: Expected Flow
✅ POST request shows status 201 (success)
✅ Response contains "requiresVerification": true
✅ Page automatically redirects to /verify-email
✅ You see 6 input boxes for OTP entry
✅ You receive email with 6-digit code

## 🔍 IF STILL NOT WORKING:

### Issue A: Backend Not Responding
- **Symptom**: "Route not found" or timeout errors
- **Solution**: Wait 3-5 more minutes for deployment
- **Test**: Try https://student-library-backend-o116.onrender.com/api/health

### Issue B: Registration Succeeds But No Redirect
- **Symptom**: Form submits but stays on registration page
- **Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Debug**: Look in Network tab for the actual response

### Issue C: Frontend JavaScript Error
- **Symptom**: Console shows red error messages
- **Solution**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5
- **Test**: Try in incognito mode

## 🎯 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST:

□ Backend health endpoint returns 200
□ Registration endpoint returns 201 with requiresVerification: true
□ Frontend Redux handles the response correctly
□ React Router has /verify-email route configured
□ No JavaScript errors in browser console
□ Email service sends OTP to your email

## 🔄 IF BACKEND IS STILL DEPLOYING:

The fixes I applied should resolve the "Route not found" issue, but Render 
deployment can take 3-5 minutes. If you still see errors:

1. **Wait 5 minutes** and try again
2. **Check backend status** at the health endpoint
3. **Hard refresh** your frontend (Ctrl+F5)
4. **Try incognito mode** to rule out cache issues

## 🌟 EXPECTED OUTCOME:

Once the deployment completes, your registration flow should work perfectly:
Registration Form → Submit → OTP Page → Email Verification → Dashboard

The root cause was that Render was deploying the wrong server configuration. 
This has now been fixed with the proper package.json setup.

## 📧 OTP EMAIL SYSTEM:

Your OTP system is configured to send emails via Gmail SMTP. After successful 
registration, you should receive an email with a 6-digit verification code 
that expires in 10 minutes.

Test it now and let me know what happens! 🚀
