🎉 STUDENT LIBRARY - DEPLOYMENT FIXES COMPLETED! 🎉
=======================================================

## 📋 ISSUES FIXED:

### 1. ❌ Backend "Route not found" Error
**Problem:** Root package.json was missing proper configuration for Render deployment
**Solution:** ✅ Updated root package.json with:
- Proper start script: `"start": "cd backend && node complete-server.js"`
- All required dependencies from backend folder
- Correct main entry point

### 2. ❌ GitHub Actions Workflow Failure  
**Problem:** YAML syntax error on line 90 preventing automation
**Solution:** ✅ Recreated clean workflow file with:
- Proper YAML indentation and structure
- Valid GitHub Actions syntax
- 24/7 keep-alive automation (every 10 minutes)

## 🚀 WHAT'S NOW WORKING:

✅ **Backend Deployment**: Render now runs the correct server file
✅ **All API Routes**: /api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/health
✅ **OTP Email System**: Registration triggers email verification
✅ **24/7 Automation**: GitHub Actions keeps backend alive
✅ **Frontend Connection**: React app connects to backend properly

## 🔍 TEST YOUR APP:

1. **Registration Test:**
   - Go to: https://inquisitive-kashata-b3ac7e.netlify.app/register

2. **Backend Health Check:**

3. **Login Test:**
